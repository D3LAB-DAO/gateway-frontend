# 🚪 Gateway | Gatway on Archway, Rewards for Everything
<img width="200" alt="supernova" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107841492/229033747-a4c4e572-16a0-4d9b-8683-aa4e85a08074.png">

## 🔭 Overview
At the heart of Gateway is our conviction that rewards are essential for accelerating the positive cycle of development, adoption, and growth of decentralized applications, or dApps.

However, the current Archway rewarding system only covers web3 actions on its platform and other Cosmos-based blockchains.

To broaden this scope and include web2 actions, we propose the Gateway, a service designed to reward web2 actions without compromising web3 decentralization principles.
